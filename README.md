# Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction

Case study on customer review rating prediction using machine learning

E-commerce has become an essential part of our daily lives. It serves as a platform that connects sellers and customers, enabling sellers to offer products and customers to purchase them online. This seamless connection between a large number of sellers and buyers defines the essence of e-commerce. 

To succeed as an e-commerce seller, providing exceptional customer service is key. But how can the quality of service be measured? The answer lies in customer satisfaction. If customers are dissatisfied with the service provided, it becomes crucial for the seller to improve service quality to attract and retain customers, ultimately boosting business growth. 

In this context, customer feedback plays a pivotal role. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding customer needs and identifying areas for improvement, making it a cornerstone of success in the e-commerce industry.

In this case study I am trying to predict customer review rating using Olist e-commerce dataset taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

Tools used : Python, Jupyter notebook, libraries: pandas, numpy,sci-kit learn, imbalanced learn, matplotlib, seaborn
